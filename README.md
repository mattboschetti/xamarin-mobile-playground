xamarin-mobile-playground
=========================

In this repository you will find a couple of mobile projects that I'm using to learn and play arround using Xamarin, they could be iOS or Android projects.
I will let you know in the description of each project what it is all about.

#### SampleAsyncTestingApp
Simple iOS app that will calculate the nth prime number, used this to demonstrate the usage of async and await in CSharp.
